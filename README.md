# User Stories

1. **As a user, I want the player to be able to hear different sounds depending on the color clicked.**
   - _So that I can have an auditory cue for each action I take in the game._

2. **As a user, I want the player to be able to repeat the given sequence.**
   - _So that I can test and improve my memory skills by recalling the sequence of colors played._

3. **As a user, I want the player to be able to level up ("proceed to the next round") when the repeated sequence is correct.**
   - _So that I can experience increasing difficulty and challenge as I progress through the game._

4. **As a user, I want the player to be able to reset the game after a lost round.**
   - _So that I can start a new game and try again after making a mistake._

## Unsolved Problems

1. Adding a Best Score Feature

The game currently lacks a feature to track and display the best score achieved by the player.


2. Using the Howler.js API for Sound Effects

The game currently uses standard HTML audio elements for sound effects. I Considered upgrading to the Howler.js library for a more sophisticated and customizable audio experience.
